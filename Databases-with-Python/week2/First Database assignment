# Instructions

# If you don't already have it, install the SQLite Browser from http://sqlitebrowser.org/.

# Then, create a SQLITE database or use an existing database and create a table in the database called "Ages":

# CREATE TABLE Ages ( 
#  name VARCHAR(128), 
#  age INTEGER
# )

# Then make sure the table is empty by deleting any rows that you previously inserted, and insert these rows and only these rows with the following commands:

# DELETE FROM Ages;
# INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Cara', 37);
# INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Rabia', 38);
# INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Tai', 24);
# INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Leea', 38);
# INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Dillan', 24);
# INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Ashbey', 13);

# Once the inserts are done, run the following SQL command:

# SELECT hex(name || age) AS X FROM Ages ORDER BY X

# Find the first row in the resulting record set and enter the long string that looks like 53656C696E613333.

# Note: This assignment must be done using SQLite - in particular, the SELECT query above will not work in any other database. So you cannot use MySQL or Oracle for this assignment.
